This is an example project that goes with a post over at Clarifai!

### Requirements
- Be sure to [sign up for a free account at Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/developer/account/signup)
- Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

### Getting Started
The default branch is **inital**. It starts as a simple Hello World example for the project.

The first thing you will need to do is `npm install` to get all package requirements. From there you can run `npm start` and the project will build and run a local server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:300).

If you want to see the rest of the project, you should switch to the **final** branch! In it, the only thing you would need to do is make sure to include your [Clarifai API Key](https://clarifai.com/developer/account/signup) for the project to see get your inputs to be searched over.
